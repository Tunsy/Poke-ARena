# Poke-ARena

## Introduction
PokeARena is a game which augments Pokemon into Pokemon trading cards by using Unity, C#, and Vuforia. PokeARena was created for Citrus Hacks 2018.

## Inspiration
Growing up, we all had very fond and nostalgic memories of watching the Pokemon series and playing its many games. As a result, we wanted to combine modern technology with our favorite childhood heroes in a fun and exciting game for everyone to play!

## What it does
When the game starts, the player gets to choose between three different types of Pokemon they want to play with. Each of the Pokemon have different advantages regarding speed and fire rate, but the player is able to switch between them throughout the game if they wish to do so. During the battle, the player must shoot orbs at other Pokemon coming towards them. The game gets progressively harder as the player levels up.

## How we built it
We used Unity and Vuforia as our foundation for the game and the AR implementation.

## Challenges we ran into
The difficult part of this project was setting up and figuring out how to divide tasks and responsibility between the group. We have never worked with AR before, so it was all a new experience. However, the most challenging part of this project was trying to fix a particularly horrible merge conflict. Half of the team was reverted back to a commit that was updated 12 hours ago. Through perseverance and teamwork, we were able to fix our problems a few hours before the deadline.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud of how far we were able to accomplish with this game, as all of us have had no experience with AR.This is the first time all of our team are working together as well, and we are proud of the diligence and hard work everyone put in to finish this project.
